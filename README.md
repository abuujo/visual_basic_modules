## general_append
This Sub allows you to append records to a main sheet. For example, if you have two sheets: one which has name and age, the other with age and color, to append these records you would need to have three columns in the main sheet and align the columns for each sub sheat. This Sub allows you to map the columns together and append the first and second sheet together in the main sheet. Look at book1 for an example.
